# Continuous Delivery and Jenkins Pipeline Demo
This is a demo project to be used to demonstrate how to quickly build a Continuous Delivery Pipeline with [Jenkins Pipeline Plugin](https://github.com/jenkinsci/pipeline-plugin/blob/master/TUTORIAL.md). This project is a fork of [cloudfoundry-samples/pong_matcher_spring](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-samples/pong_matcher_spring) as an example application written in java.
